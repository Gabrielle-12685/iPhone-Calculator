# iPhone-Calculator
I am recently new to coding and programming languages. I decided to make an iphone calculator, because I enjoy being creative and setting myself challenging tasks to complete. I am open to feedback on this code as I am a beginner. I also research a few coding techniques and videos beforehand. Please feel free to feedback to me how I can improve my code. Thank you!
